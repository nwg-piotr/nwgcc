MODIFY CAREFULLY, IF AT ALL!

These files represent CLI commands with arguments, used by the program.
The output of some of them is being parsed in a specific way, so changing the result is more than likely
to give unexpected results, or even crash the program.

DO NOT change them unless you REALLY need to (e.g. to use `egrep` instead of `grep`).
In case you did something wrong, just delete the file. It'll be re-created on next run.

Sample expected output:

get_battery:

$ upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT) | grep --color=never -E 'state|to\\ full|to\\ empty|percentage'
    state:               fully-charged
    percentage:          100%

get_battery_alt:

$ acpi
Battery 0: Full, 100%

get_bluetooth_name:

$ bluetoothctl show | grep Name
	Name: msi

get_bluetooth_status:

$ bluetoothctl show | grep Powered
	Powered: no

get_brightness:

$ light -G
25.88

get_host:

$ uname -n
msi

get_ssid

$ iwgetid -r
Zhone_CE44

get_user:

$ echo $USER
piotr

set_brightness:

$ light -S <nwgcc_appends_a_value>

systemctl:
