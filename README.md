# nwgcc
nwg Control Center is a higly customisable, GTK-based GUI, intended for use with window managers. 
It may serve as an extension to bars / panels, providing built-in and user-defined controls. 
Default theme may be overridden with custom css style sheets.

This is a work in progress, not yet production ready.

Main window, Nordic-bluish-accent GTK theme, custom icons Light:
